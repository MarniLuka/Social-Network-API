# Social Network API

## Description
The challenge was to build an API for a social network application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. Express was using for routing, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose for the ODM.

## Installation
Node and Insomnia must first be downloaded and installed on your computer. 

The necessary dependencies are included in the package.json file, so you just need to run 'npm i' in your terminal on the root level of this directory. 

## Usage
Now that the necessary packages are installed, to use this application, you can simply write 'npm run start' into your terminal at the root level. Once it's running you can use Insomnia to use the API routes to get, post, put, and/or delete data in the database you created.

A demonstration video will be provided later (having issues with screencastify currently).
